Speech recognition is a process of converting voice instructions into text, and it is also known as __Speech to text__, or __Computer based speech recognition__ At present, machine learning algorithms are widely used by various applications of speech recognition. Google assistant, Siri, Cortana, and Alexa are using speech recognition technology to follow the voice instructions.\n",
